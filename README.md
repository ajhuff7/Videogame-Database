# 1UP Video Game Database

## Description

An app where video game fans use sign up and login functionality through passport, passport-local, and bcrypt to create a profile on our database using mysql and sequelize that lets them search for their favorite video games using axios, express, and the IGDB api and curate a list of their favorites. Users can then send recommendations of games to other users on the app as well!

## Motivation

We wanted to create an app that let users find their favorite games and be able to recommend them to their friends. 


## Installation/ User Guide

Simply create a profile with your name, email, password, and date of birth to start searching for your favorite video games and recommending them to your friends!
